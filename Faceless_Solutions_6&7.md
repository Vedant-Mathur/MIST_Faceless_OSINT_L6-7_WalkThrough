## Level 6

### Q1: Divine Obsession

> Can you figure out who Pradyumna holds as his favourite deity?  
> hint: ![alt text](<img/L6_A.png>)

**Solution:**  
This one was fairly easy — we needed to connect Level 5 to Level 6. From the screenshot, you gather that you must visit the Pinterest profile of *Pradyumna Dangwal*.  
![alt text](<img/6A sol1.png>)  

On his profile, you see he's collaborated on a pinboard with *Arjun Bhujiawala* and has several gods pinned. Digging deeper into *Arjun Bhujiawala's* profile, two profiles stand out — *Roonil* and *Prakhar Agarwal*.  

When you inspect these profiles, *Prakhar Agarwal* has created only one pin.

From the comment there, you can narrow down *Perses* as Pradyumna's favourite god.

**Answer:** `perses`

A quick check revealed:
