## Level 6

### Q1: Divine Obsession

> Can you figure out who Pradyumna holds as his favourite deity?  
> hint: ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/HfWcvkj8/L6-A.png)

**Solution:**  
This one was fairly easy — we needed to connect Level 5 to Level 6. From the screenshot, you gather that you must visit the Pinterest profile of *Pradyumna Dangwal*.  
![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/nMdY0WG8/6A-sol1.png)  

On his profile, you see he's collaborated on a pinboard with *Arjun Bhujiawala* and has several gods pinned. Digging deeper into *Arjun Bhujiawala's* profile, two profiles stand out — *Roonil* and *Prakhar Agarwal*.  

When you inspect these profiles, *Prakhar Agarwal* has created only one pin.

From the comment there, you can narrow down *Perses* as Pradyumna's favourite god.

**Answer:** `perses`

### Q2: Silent Coordinates

> What city is Pradyumna currently in?

**Solution:**  
From Pradyumna's Pinterest profile, head to his GitHub account linked there:

Browsing through his public repositories didn’t reveal much, so the next logical step was checking hidden data in a GitHub profile like gists.  
A quick check revealed:
